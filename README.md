This Readme file is a work in progress.

I am not a coder! 
Over the years as I became heavily involved in the world of IT for my career, I found Powershell scripts made my life a lot easier. 
I would spend hours searching the internet for other people's scripts to help make my work easier and better. 

Oddly enough, the collective hours I spent searching online for other people's powershell scripts and trying to tweak them for my specific needs
and uses, I could have just sat down and learned Powershell.

This repository will serve as a small and tiny way for me to give back to the internet community for what they helped give to me.
