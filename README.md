This Readme file is a work in progress.

I am not a coder! 
Over the years as I became heavily involved in the world of IT for my career, I found Powershell scripts made my life a lot easier. 
I would spend hours searching the internet for other people's scripts to help make my work easier and better. 

Oddly enough, the collective hours I spent searching online for other people's powershell scripts and trying to tweak them for my specific needs
and uses, I could have just sat down and learned Powershell.

This repository will serve as a small and tiny way for me to give back to the internet community for what they helped give to me.

About my Powershell Scripts.
----------------------------
Where possible, I've tried to add the following to my scripts:

- Remarks
I've tried to add Remarks in my code to make it a bit easier to follow,
though this is usually an after thought when I've created my scripts. 

-Input\Output
Most of my scripts are designed to carry a large workload, such as checking
a thousand+ servers. As such I created my script to pull it's Input from a text file
and to push it's output to a CSV file.

- Visual Countdown\Progress of script
I began adding some kind of countdown or progress bar to my scripts to display
on the console when they are running, to help give an indication of how far along
the script is to completion. The last thing you want to do is kill a script
while it's running because you're not seeing a response after a period of
time and think the script froze when it was actually still running.
